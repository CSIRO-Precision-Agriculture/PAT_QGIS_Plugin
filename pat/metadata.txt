name=PAT - Precision Agriculture Tools
description=A collection of tools for processing precision agriculture data.

about=PAT is a QGIS plugin for tools required for processing and analysing precision agriculture data. It includes tools for data cleaning and map interpolation to create TIFF's from high spatial density on-the-go sensor data such as yield monitor or EM38 soil sensor data. There are also tools for analysis of remotely sensed imagery and for the clustering of multiple datasets.
      .
      This is a Windows only plugin, This plugin requires the installation of the following Python libraries: pyprecag, fiona, and rasterio. Full installation instructions are provided in the manual available at: https://github.com/CSIRO-Precision-Agriculture/PAT_QGIS_Plugin/blob/master/pat/PAT_User_Manual.pdf
      .
      Developed by the CSIRO Precision Agriculture Team, this project is supported by Wine Australia through funding from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources as part of its Rural R&D for Profit program.
